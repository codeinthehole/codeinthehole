## About me
I'm the Head of Software Engineering at [Octopus Energy](https://octopus.energy/).

I used to maintain several open-source projects but I do less open-source work these days. I'm the original author of [`django-oscar`](https://github.com/django-oscar/django-oscar) although I'm not active in the project any more.
